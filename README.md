## Danny Ma's 8 Week SQL Challenge 

This repository contains my solutions and outputs for the 8-week SQL challenge. During this challenge, I practiced a wide range of SQL topics, from basic to complex queries and data cleaning techniques.

The 8-week SQL challenge is a hands-on, real-world practice of SQL skills designed to cover a wide range of topics. Each week, I tackled different SQL problems related to:
- Writing basic to advanced SQL queries
- Data filtering and sorting
- Data aggregation and joining multiple tables
- Data cleaning and transformation

- By completing this challenge, I was able to sharpen my SQL skills and gain practical experience in solving common database problems.
